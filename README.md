## Server Functionality
The server.go file sets up a server with TLS configuration and handles a "/hello" resource. It loads the server's certificate and private key generated by the bash script and the CA certificate from the configuration. The server listens to port 8080 and waits for incoming requests.

When a request is received, the server handles it by writing "Hello, world!" to the response body. The server uses the tls.Config object with the server's certificate, the CA certificate pool, and sets ClientAuth to tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert.

## Client Functionality
The client.go file sets up a client with TLS configuration and makes a GET request to the "/hello" resource. It loads the client's certificate and private key generated by the bash script and the CA certificate from the configuration.

The client makes a request to the "/hello" resource over port 8080 via the GET method. It reads the response body and prints it to stdout. The client uses the tls.Config object with the client's certificate, the CA certificate pool, and sets InsecureSkipVerify to false.

## Summary
The server and client both use TLS configuration for secure communication. The server listens for incoming requests and responds with a greeting, while the client makes requests and handles the responses. They interact with each other over port 8080, with the client making GET requests to the server's "/hello" resource.
